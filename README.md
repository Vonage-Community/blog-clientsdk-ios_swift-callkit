# Swift Client SDK Phone to App With Push Notifications

This is a Swift project that uses the [Client SDK](https://developer.vonage.com/vonage-client-sdk/overview) to receive inbound calls from a phone with a [CallKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit) integration for push notifications.

## Running the project

The push notifications in the project require set up with your Apple developer account and your Vonage API account. See the [documentation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/vonage-client-sdk/set-up-push-notifications/ios) on steps how to do so.

You will need to run the application on a physical device to make use of push notifications.
